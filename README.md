A sign in/register for a todo list application using react and axios.
This project is meant to have a redux component for storing the sign in/sign out state.
Unfortuantly my level of understanding could not let me reach my goals for this project, therefore more time is needed to complete it.
The to-do application allows you to store a todo item in a list, edit the item and delete the item. Unfortunantly with this part of the project, I would have liked to be able to store the list items so they could be sprted as complete and incomplete. 
This component too needs more work.
This project was done in 24 hours.
